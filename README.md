# FIFA19 Complete Player Dataset
Studying the database of FIFA 19 players and performing analyzes. Creating models for better allocation and player performance.

I used the data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) website:

### With Machine Learning techniques to group players

K-Means was used to group the players, according to their characteristics. The Random Forest was used to classify their positions on the field and the most important attributes.


## **Conclusions:**
These analyzes give us the conclusion that we can separate the players into 4 groups. And it also allows us to be aware of the most important characteristics for the realization of the grouping and in this way to be able to improve efficiency. You can also have the result if that player is better in that position, considering his characteristics or if by them, it is better to be allocated to other groups, where he can show better performance. **Enables the best allocation of the player.**
